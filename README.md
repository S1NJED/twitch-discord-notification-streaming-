# discord-twitch-notification-streaming-

Receive a notification on discord when a streamers that you add to the list. I used Twitch API, i know that polling is very bad but I am still learning ^^

To add, delete streamers in the list use add_streamers.py

Prequerisite:
  
  - Client-id, Client-secret that you will get when creating an application on the twitch API website.
  - a discord webhook url
  You will need to edit twitch.py and paste all the informations in the constructor. Have fun ^^

If you have any advice to give me about my codes, please PM me :D

My discord: SINJED#3850
